  longDescription: >
    SchemaCrawler is a free database schema discovery and comprehension tool.
    SchemaCrawler has a good mix of useful features for data governance. You can
    search for database schema objects using regular expressions, and output the
    schema and data in a readable text format. The output serves for database
    documentation, and is designed to be diff-ed against other database schemas.
    SchemaCrawler also generates schema diagrams. You can execute scripts in any
    standard scripting language against your database. You can find potential schema
    design issues with lint.
